# ResearchAssistant(IN PROGRESS)

App designed to help people with research. Simply enter some keywords, and the app will scrape several websites for the information and return a compressed version with all the relevant information from multiple sites. It will also return the links it used ranked in order of the number of keyword matches.

Flask for the backend and React.JS(Maybe Next.JS) for the frontend 

To run the app:

**flask run**

This should run on localhost:5000
